# Fact-generator
Created a Web App that generates a fact with the information that the user passes.

In the .env-example there's the information of the api used in the project. If anyone wants to use this app he has to create an account on rapid api and get an API key which he/she will replace on the .enx-example API key and change the files name to ".env".
